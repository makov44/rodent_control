        <h2>Signs You Have an Animal Infestation</h2>
        <p>If you aren't 100% certain that you have a rodent or rat infestation, but you are afraid to check your attic or crawl space, here are some signs to look out for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Animal Droppings</li>
            <li>Scurring or Scratching Sounds</li>
            <li>Chewed Walls and Wires</li>
            <li>Grease and Dirt Smudges</li>
            <li>Squeaking Noises</li>
            <li>Damaged Insulation</li>
            <li>Nesting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Do Animals Get Into Your Home?</h2>
        <p>Pests and rodents can squeeze themselves into the tiniest holes, cracks, or crevices in your home. All holes and cracks, no matter how small, is an invitation for the critters to make a home in your attic.</p>
        <p>They can climb trees that are near your attic, but also enter through other ways such as holes in your roof, through your garage and into the walls where they can nest in your warm attic insulation. Getting your attic rodent-proofed is the only way to keep them out permanently.</p>

        <h2>How Pests and Rodents Can Damage Your Home</h2>
        <p>If you think a tiny little mouse is too cute and won't do too much damage to your attic, you are wrong. The little rodents can do thousands of dollars worth of damage to your attic or home.</p>
        <p>They are chewers and will chew through any and everything. From drywall to electrical wires to plastic containers, our professionals have seen it all! If you have chewed electrical wires, they can be an extreme fire hazard, and with all that insulation in attics mixed with frayed wires, can be extremely frightening!</p>
        <p>Once there is one hole that rodents enter though, more and more will enter, as well as water. This could lead to mold issues.</p>
        <p>Rodents also urinate and defecate in their living areas — in this case, your attic — and their waste is extremely toxic for humans.</p>
        <p>Most times if there is a rodent infestation, you will need to replace all the insulation in your attic. That's why pest control is a crucial part of keeping your home intact.</p>

        <h2>Are Rats Really Harmful to Your Health?</h2>
        <p>Rodents can carry harmful bacteria, dangerous diseases, and allergens that cause respiratory issues and illnesses. If you find rodents in your home, you need to get the problem eradicated right away!</p>
        <p>Rodents and their infectious diseases should not be taken lightly. The diseases can lead to fatal respiratory problems for humans. Mice and rats can carry and spread 35+ diseases. Whether you are handling alive or dead rodents, feces, urine, bites, or saliva, you have to be extremely careful and cautious — which is why it should be left to the professionals.</p>
        <p>Rodents that are infected, can infect people with fleas, mites, and ticks! Some even carry ringworms and tapeworms that people can contract.</p>

        <h2>Why You Shouldn't DIY Rodent Removal</h2>
        <p>Removing harmful decaying rodents, or live rodents, without the proper equipment can be harmful. Rodent removal should not be your Saturday DIY project. Poisons and traps are only temporary and won't prevent the rodents from returning.</p>
        <p>Only professionals can find every point of entry and seal them for good. Our rodent removal and rodent-proofing specialists use state-of-the-art cleaners and sprays that will sanitize the germs and bacteria that the rodents carried into your home and left behind in their urine and feces. When you are suffering from a rodent infestation, ridding your home of the rodents yourself is strongly recommended against.</p>
